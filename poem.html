    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br>
        Are you - Nobody - Too? <br>
        Then there's a pair of us! <br>
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
    <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br>
        How public - like a Frog - <br>
        To tell one's name - the livelong June - <br>
        To an admiring Bog!</p>
